# A-2015-inventory-of-embodied-carbon-emissions-for-Chinese-power-transmission-infrastructure-projects
Source code for article &lt;A 2015 inventory of embodied carbon emissions for Chinese power transmission infrastructure projects> submitted to Scientific Data 
This is the MATLAB Code used to generate the emission intensity via multi-regional input-output analysis and uncertainties via Monte Carlo simulation is attached below for transparency and verifiability. We take 41 transmission line projects under 220kv as an example.
